\usage{
ch_queries(variables, layers, models = NA, scenarios = NA, timeframes)
}
\arguments{
\item{variables}{character vector, options include "tmin", "tmax", "temp",
"prec", and "bio".}

\item{layers}{integer vector, options include 1:12 for base variables
(representing months) and 1:19 for bio (representing biovariable number).}

\item{models}{character vector, specify only for future data.}

\item{scenarios}{character vector, specify only for future data.}

\item{timeframes}{character vector, options include "1979-2013", "2014-2060",
and "2061-2080".}
}
\value{
a data frame of metadata for all factorial combinations of the
  requested variables
}
\description{
This function constructs a set of download URLs for the requested
combinations of metadata variables. It currently supports download of
historic climatologies and future CMIP5 model predictions for both basic
monthly variables and bioclimatic variables. CHELSA provides historic data in
integer*10 format and floating point format, but only the former is available
using this function, for consistency with CMIP5 futures which are available
only in integer*10 format.
